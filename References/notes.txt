TODO: 
must:
- import on file level
- Track view to album view - preselect selected track
- improve editing, split up in:
	rename and order tracks
	set album title and artist name
	set album artwork
- clean up documents directory on every start and/or maybe periodically or after download queue finished. 
- downloads should go to background queue!! bug, start download, goto lock screen - download stops in the middle
- prevent adding the same file to download queue twice


nice:
- cancel all downloads (?)
- import folders recursive
